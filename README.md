************************
Update possible :
1. I have used the static data file for the corona virus cases  if any one have a end point from which the dynamic updated data is 
    available than that is must required update .
2. there is  the empty box at the left side of the  index.html  when you run that file  that box is there for hover effect of the mapbox
    that should show the cases number when someone hover on the any marker .
